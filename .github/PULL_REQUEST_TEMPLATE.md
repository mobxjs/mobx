    If you are creating an extensive PR, you might want to open an issue with your idea first in case there is a chance for rejecting it.

    If you intend to work on PR over several days, please, create [draft pull requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).

    Keep in mind we are maintaining MobX 4 & 5 in the repo. If applicable, change both.

    Please look at the following checklist to ensure that your PR can be accepted quickly:
-->

### Code change checklist

-   [ ] Added/updated unit tests
-   [ ] Updated changelog
-   [ ] Updated `/docs`. For new functionality, at least `API.md` should be updated
-   [ ] Verified that there is no significant performance drop (`npm run perf`)

    Feel free to ask help with any of these boxes!

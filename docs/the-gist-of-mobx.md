# The gist of MobX

## Concepts

MobX distinguishes between the following three concepts in your application:

1. State
2. Actions
3. Derivations

Let's take a closer look at these concepts below, or alternatively, in the [10 minute introduction to MobX and React](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started), where you can interactively dive deeper into these concepts step by step and build a simple Todo list app.

Some might recognise the concept of "Signals" in the concepts described below.
This is correct, MobX is a signal based state management library avant la lettre.

### 1. Define state and make it observable

_State_ is the data that drives your application.
Usually, there is _domain specific state_ like a list of todo items, and there is _view state_, such as the currently selected element.
State is like spreadsheet cells that hold a value.

Store state in any data structure you like: plain objects, arrays, classes, cyclic data structures or references. It doesn't matter for the workings of MobX.
Just make sure that all properties you want to change over time are marked as `observable` so MobX can track them.

Here is a simple example:

```javascript
import { makeObservable, observable, action } from "mobx"

class Todo {
    id = Math.random()
    title = ""
    finished = false

    constructor(title) {
        makeObservable(this, {
            title: observable,
            finished: observable,
            toggle: action
        })
        this.title = title
    }

    toggle() {
        this.finished = !this.finished
    }
}
```

Using `observable` is like turning a property of an object into a spreadsheet cell.
But unlike spreadsheets, these values can not only be primitive values, but also references, objects and arrays.

<details><summary>Tip: Prefer classes, plain objects or decorators? MobX supports many styles.</summary>

This example can be shortened using [`makeAutoObservable`](observable-state.md), but by being explicit we can showcase the different concepts in greater detail.
Note that MobX doesn't dictate an object style, plain objects instead can be used as well, as can decorators for even more concise classes. See the page for more details.

</details>

But what about `toggle`, which we marked as `action`?

### 2. Update state using actions

An _action_ is any piece of code that changes the _state_. User events, backend data pushes, scheduled events, etc.
An action is like a user that enters a new value into a spreadsheet cell.

In the `Todo` model above you can see that we have a `toggle` method that changes the value of `finished`. `finished` is marked as `observable`. It is recommended that you mark any piece of code that changes `observable`'s as an [`action`](actions.md). That way MobX can automatically apply transactions for effortless optimal performance.

Using actions helps you structure your code and prevents you from inadvertently changing state when you don't intend to.
Methods that modify state are called _actions_ in MobX terminology. In contrast to _views_, which compute new information based on the current state.
Every method should serve at most one of those two goals.

### 3. Create derivations that automatically respond to state changes

_Anything_ that can be derived from the _state_ without any further interaction is a derivation.
Derivations exist in many forms:

-   The _user interface_
-   _Derived data_, such as the number of remaining `todos`
-   _Backend integrations_, e.g. sending changes to the server

MobX distinguishes between two kinds of derivations:

-   _Computed values_, which can always be derived from the current observable state using a pure function
-   _Reactions_, side effects that need to happen automatically when the state changes (bridge between imperative and reactive programming)

When starting with MobX, people tend to overuse reactions.
The golden rule is, always use `computed` if you want to create a value based on the current state.

#### 3.1. Model derived values using computed

To create a _computed_ value, define a property using a JS getter function `get` and mark it as `computed` with `makeObservable`.

```javascript
import { makeObservable, observable, computed } from "mobx"

class TodoList {
    todos = []
    get unfinishedTodoCount() {
        return this.todos.filter(todo => !todo.finished).length
    }
    constructor(todos) {
        makeObservable(this, {
            todos: observable,
            unfinishedTodoCount: computed
        })
        this.todos = todos
    }
}
```

MobX will ensure that `unfinishedTodoCount` is updated automatically when a todo is added or when one of the `finished` properties is modified.

These computations resemble formulas in spreadsheet programs like MS Excel. They update automatically, but only when required. That is, if something is interested in their outcome.

#### 3.2. Model side effects using reactions

For you as a user to be able to see a change in state or computed values on the screen, a _reaction_ that repaints a part of the GUI is needed.

Reactions are similar to computed values, but instead of producing information, they produce side effects like printing to the console, making network requests, incrementally updating React component tree to patch the DOM, etc.

In short, reactions bridge the worlds of [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) and [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) programming.

By far the most used form of reactions are UI components.
Note that it is possible to trigger side effects from both actions and reactions.
Side effects that have a clear, explicit origin from which they can be triggered, such
as making a network request when submitting a form, should be triggered explicitly from the relevant event handler.

#### 3.3. Reactive React components

If you are using React, you can make your components reactive by wrapping them with the [`observer`](react-integration.md) function from the bindings package you've [chosen during installation](installation.md#installation). In this example, we're going to use the more lightweight `mobx-react-lite` package.

```javascript
import * as React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { observer } from "mobx-react-lite"

const TodoListView = observer(({ todoList }) => (
    <div>
        <ul>
            {todoList.todos.map(todo => (
                <TodoView todo={todo} key={todo.id} />
            ))}
        </ul>
        Tasks left: {todoList.unfinishedTodoCount}
    </div>
))

const TodoView = observer(({ todo }) => (
    <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked={todo.finished} onClick={() => todo.toggle()} />
        {todo.title}
    </li>
))

const store = new TodoList([new Todo("Get Coffee"), new Todo("Write simpler code")])
render(<TodoListView todoList={store} />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

`observer` converts React components into derivations of the data they render.
When using MobX there are no smart or dumb components.
All components render smartly, but are defined in a dumb manner. MobX will simply make sure the components are always re-rendered whenever needed, and never more than that.

So the `onClick` handler in the above example will force the proper `TodoView` component to re-render as it uses the `toggle` action, but will only cause the `TodoListView` component to re-render if the number of unfinished tasks has changed.
And if you would remove the `Tasks left` line (or put it into a separate component), the `TodoListView` component would no longer re-render when ticking a task.

To learn more about how React works with MobX, check out the [React integration](react-integration.md) section.

#### 3.4. Custom reactions

You will need them rarely, but they can be created using the [`autorun`](reactions.md#autorun),
[`reaction`](reactions.md#reaction) or [`when`](reactions.md#when) functions to fit your specific situations.
For example, the following `autorun` prints a log message every time the amount of `unfinishedTodoCount` changes:

```javascript
// A function that automatically observes the state.
autorun(() => {
    console.log("Tasks left: " + todos.unfinishedTodoCount)
})
```

Why does a new message get printed every time the `unfinishedTodoCount` is changed? The answer is this rule of thumb:

_MobX reacts to any existing observable property that is read during the execution of a tracked function._

To learn more about how MobX determines which observables need to be reacted to, check out the [Understanding reactivity](understanding-reactivity.md) section.

## Principles

MobX uses a uni-directional data flow where _actions_ change the _state_, which in turn updates all affected _views_.


![Action, State, View](assets/action-state-view.png)

1. All _derivations_ are updated **automatically** and **atomically** when the _state_ changes. As a result, it is never possible to observe intermediate values.

2. All _derivations_ are updated **synchronously** by default. This means that, for example, _actions_ can safely inspect a computed value directly after altering the _state_.

3. _Computed values_ are updated **lazily**. Any computed value that is not actively in use will not be updated until it is needed for a side effect (I/O).
   If a view is no longer in use it will be garbage collected automatically.

4. All _computed values_ should be **pure**. They are not supposed to change _state_.

## Linting

If you find it hard to adopt the mental model of MobX, configure it to be very strict and warn you at runtime whenever you deviate from these patterns. Check out the [linting MobX](configuration.md#linting-options) section.

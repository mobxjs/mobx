Thanks for taking the effort to create a PR!

If you are creating an extensive PR, you might want to open an issue with your idea first, so that you don't put a lot of effort in an PR that wouldn't be accepted. Please prepend pull requests with `WIP: ` if they are not yet finished
PR checklist:

* [ ] Added unit tests
* [ ] Updated changelog
* [ ] Updated docs (either in the description of this PR as markdown, or as seperate PR on the `gh-pages` branch. Please refer to this PR). For new functionality, at least [API.md](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/gh-pages/docs/refguide/api.md) should be updated
* [ ] Added typescript typings
* [ ] Verified that there is no significant performance drop (`npm run perf`)

Feel free to ask help with any of these boxes!

The above process doesn't apply to doc updates etc.

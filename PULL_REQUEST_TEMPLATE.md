Thanks for taking the effort to create a PR!

If you are creating an extensive issue, you might want to open an issue with your idea first, so that you don't put a lot of effort in an PR that wouldn't be accepted ;-).

PR checklist:

* [ ] Implementation
* [ ] Added tests
* [ ] Verified that there is no significant performance drop (`npm run perf`)
* [ ] Updated (either in the description of this PR as markdown, or as seperate PR on the `gh-pages` branch. Please refer to this PR). For new functionality, at least [API.md](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/blob/gh-pages/docs/refguide/api.md) should be updated
* [ ] Added type annotations (if you are unfamiliar with typescript, untyped, `:any` based PR's are welcome as well
